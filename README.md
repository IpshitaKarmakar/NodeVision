# NodeVision  (Project using Data Structures and Algorithms-Tree and Heap concepts)

Overview

Tree Visualizer is an interactive application designed to help users visualize and understand tree-based data structures and their algorithms. The app provides dynamic visualizations for:

Binary Tree Visualization

Max Heap Visualization

Binary Search Tree (BST) Visualization

Using this tool, students, developers, and educators can better comprehend how these data structures work by observing their behavior in real-time as operations are performed.

Features

Binary Tree Visualization :-
Display a binary tree structure dynamically.
Support for adding, deleting, and traversing nodes.
Visualize traversal algorithms: Inorder, Preorder, and Postorder.

Max Heap Visualization :-
Insert and remove nodes in the max heap.
Automatically display heap structure during insertions and deletions.
Highlight the max heap property after each operation.

Binary Search Tree (BST) Visualization :-
Insert, search, and delete nodes in the BST.
Visualize search operations and tree balancing dynamically.
Show the BST properties in real time.

Usage

Binary Tree:
Enter values to create nodes.
Select operations like add, delete, or traverse.
Watch the tree update dynamically.

Max Heap:
Insert values to observe heap adjustments.
Remove the root to see the re-heapification process.

Binary Search Tree (BST):
Add nodes to build the BST.
Search for a specific value and see its position.
Delete nodes and watch the tree reorganize.
